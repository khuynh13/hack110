            <h3>â€‹READ ALL PRIOR TO STARTING YOUR FINAL PROJECT</h3>
            <p>There are two options for a final project in COMP110.</p>
            <blockquote>
              The default option is to complete <b>Problem Set 6 - TBA</b>.<br><br>
              <b>The HACK110 Option requires attending the hackathon and choosing your own final project to create</b>. To choose this option you must attend the hackathon and get your project opt-in code before 11:59pm (instructions following). <b>Taking on a custom project is far more challenging than the default problem set will be!</b><br><br>
              HACK110 projects are *not* due until LDOC. The purpose of HACK110 is to make significant progress and get a running head start on your final project. TA assistance will be exclusively available during the hackathon (there is no guarantee that the TAs in office hours can help you).<br><br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Want to do both? That's encouraged, too! To keep things fair for all students, there's no extra credit involved for completing both. Only extra street cred.</p><br>
            <p><b>MAXIMUM TEAM SIZE: 2 people</b></p><br>

            <h3><b>Steps for the Hackathon Final Project</b></h3>
            <blockquote>
              Attend either the Game or Web Dev Workshop at 8pm! - This will determine what the nature of your project will be.<br>
              Disperse into the lobby to begin hacking on final projects.<br>
              <b>Come up with an idea!</b> Don't know what to make? Try pairing up with a peer or chatting with a classmate and brainstorming! Need some ideas? Check out our recommended project ideas and see what past students have submitted <a href="#">HERE</a>!<br>
              <b>Before 11:59pm, submit a conceptual help ticket in the office hours app and get your project approved by a TA!</b> After doing so, you will be given an "opt-in code" and should complete the opt-in form found HERE. Both team members, if working as a team, should complete this form using the same opt-in code.<br>
              <b>Hack!</b> Try to complete or make a substantial dent in your project at the hackathon! You don't HAVE to finish, but hopefully you'll knock out a huge portion of it! Google and StackOverflow are your friends for solving problems you've never tried to solve before. Staff will be circulating around to try and help push past road blocks or brainstorm workarounds.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
            <blockquote>
              Your project must be an HTML/CSS/TypeScript project that gets published to apps.introcs.com<br>
              Setup a folder in your "src/" directory called "hack110" and setup your HTML/TypeScript and CSS (if any) here.<br>
              In your project, there must be a file named "project-spec.html" which has the following contents:
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Description of Project</li>
              <li>Team Member (if pairing up)</li>
              <li>110 Programming Concepts Used (what, how, and why?)</li>
              <li>Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned</li>
              <li>A link to the "Starting Page" of your app</li>
              <li>(If group work) Individual Contributions to the Project</li>
              <li>Goals Achieved</li>
              <li>Goals Outstanding / Future Work</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Later on, you will have access to a form for your final project submission. It will be a form for letting us know the URL of your project's page. Only one submission (and one Spec Page page) on this form will be required per team, but each of you is encouraged to work through your code and publish to your own account.</p>
            <p>Not meeting your complete vision for the original project is completely acceptable - visions evolve!  But you should have code that runs and represents a body of work that demonstrates 12+ hours of effort.</p>

    <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
